Symmetric Learning
==================

**Symmetric Learning** is a machine learning library tailored to optimization problems featuring symmetry priors. It provides equivariant neural network modules, models, and utilities for leveraging group symmetries in data.

Key Features
------------

- **Neural Network Modules** (`nn`): Equivariant layers including linear, convolutional, normalization, and attention modules that respect group symmetries.
- **Models** (`models`): Ready-to-use architectures like equivariant MLPs, Transformers, and CNN encoders for time-series and structured data.
- **Linear Algebra** (`linalg`): Utilities for symmetric vector spaces—least squares, invariant projections, and isotypic decompositions.
- **Statistics** (`stats`): Functions for computing statistics (mean, variance, covariance) of symmetric random variables.
- **Representation Theory** (`representation_theory`): Tools for working with group representations, homomorphism bases, and irreducible decompositions.
