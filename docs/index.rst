Lightweight python package for doing geometric deep learning using ESCNN. This package simply holds:

- Generic equivariant torch models and modules that are not present in ESCNN.
- Linear algebra utilities when working with symmetric vector spaces.
- Statistics utilities for symmetric random variables.
