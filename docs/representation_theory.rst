representation_theory
=====================

.. module:: symm_learning.representation_theory

Utility functions for doing linear algebra on symmetric vector spaces, including:
least squares solutions, group invariant projections, and
:ref:`isotypic decomposition <isotypic-decomposition-example>`.

For the full decomposition definition, notation convention, and a practical
Icosahedral example, see
:ref:`Isotypic Decomposition <isotypic-decomposition-example>`.
